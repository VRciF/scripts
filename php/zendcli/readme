this command line project can be used like:
php5 ./index.php [CONTROLLER] [ACTION]
OR
./index.php [CONTROLLER] [ACTION]

usage:
for example you create a new controller ExampleController in controllers/ directory with an action like 'someAction()'
you can call it like
./index.php Example some


this cli project also includes a cronjob abstraction for *nix like cronjobs
as an example you can load the Cron Config, located at Config/Cron.php and run
APPLICATION_CONFIG=Cron ./index.php Sample

which force's to run the Sample Cronjob located at Cron/Job/Sample.php

what's the purpose of this Cronjob abstraction:
given the case you have a project which needs to execute some code via a cronjob
one thing you can do is just write a php script and then execute the code at given time via e.g. linux's crontab
a few weeks later you need to add a second cronjob
each time you add a new job you have to ask the admin to get access to the server and install your script

this project provides 2 helpfull purposes:
first you add a new cronjob via a new class and a new entry in Config/crontab - then update your project on the server as normally for every php script you have
second you have zend framework in your cronjob onboard

Installation:
add the following line to your operating system crontab
* * * * * APPLICATION_CONFIG=Cron /path/to/zendcli/index.php

this causes index.php to be executed every minute and the cronjobs in Config/crontab executed as needed
adding a new entry in Config/crontab causes the new job to be working immediately

Cronjob Usage:
the following
APPLICATION_CONFIG=Cron ZF_PATH=/path/to/ZendFramework/1.11.2 ./index.php Sample

Environment variables:
to switch the config you can set APPLICATION_CONFIG environment variable e.g.
to switch from default to Cronjob config: APPLICATION_CONFIG=Cron ./index.php Sample

to set the path to zend framework library use ZF_PATH environment variable like:
ZF_PATH=/path/to/ZendFramework/1.11.2 ./index.php Example some

to set both try:
APPLICATION_CONFIG=Cron ZF_PATH=/path/to/ZendFramework/1.11.2 ./index.php Sample
